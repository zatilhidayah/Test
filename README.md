# Exercise: Sorting data

Introduction
By now you should be familiar with the sorting feature in Microsoft Excel. In this exercise, you’ll reorganize the data in a worksheet so that rows are grouped in a particular order. You’ll do this by using both standard and multi-level sorts. By completing this exercise, you’ll be able to use these skills to sort numbers and text on large worksheets in a focused way.
